# Mini Compiler 
A smaller, less robust compiler made for a college assignment. The [problem statement](https://github.com/cn-mm/MiniCompiler/blob/main/Problem%20Statement.pdf) required us to create a grammar for a new language supporting primitive types such as integer, boolean and floating point and also arrays and jagged arrays. Their specifications and syntax is mentioned in the problem statement pdf.

## Tasks:
1. Create grammar for the new language.
2. Tokenize the source code 
3. Create and Traverse Parse Tree 

7 test cases have been provided in the Test Cases folder. All test cases follow the syntax of the new language.
